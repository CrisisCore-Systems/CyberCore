# Trauma Resonance Vector System

The Trauma Resonance Vector System transforms scalar trauma values into multidimensional vectors that can propagate coherent emotional states throughout the system architecture.

## Core Concepts

### Resonance Field

A resonance field is a multidimensional representation of emotional trauma with the following properties:

- **X-Dimension**: Oscillatory dimension, creating circular or wave-based patterns
- **Y-Dimension**: Phase-shifted dimension, perpendicular to X
- **Z-Dimension**: Direct trauma mapping, with optional non-linear curves
- **Strength**: Amplitude coefficient, determines intensity of effect
- **Coherence**: Binding stability, determines how cleanly the effect propagates

### Waveforms

Different waveforms create distinct emotional signatures:

1. **Sine (Default)**

   - Smooth, gradual transitions between emotional states
   - Rounded peaks and valleys create natural emotional flow
   - Perfect for subtle emotional resonance
   - Most harmonious with organic memory crystallization

2. **Triangle**

   - Sharp, linear transitions between emotional extremes
   - Creates more defined emotional boundaries
   - Excellent for security-trauma vectors where clear thresholds matter
   - Good for crystalline and digital aesthetics

3. **Sawtooth**

   - Gradual build-up with sudden release
   - Creates tension-and-release emotional patterns
   - Ideal for commerce-trauma when building anticipation
   - Effective for glitch/corrupted aesthetics

4. **Square**

   - Harsh, binary emotional states
   - Creates stark, immediate transitions
   - Useful for alert/danger scenarios
   - Creates distinctly digital emotional signatures

5. **Pulse**

   - Controllable duty cycle for asymmetric emotional states
   - Creates uneven emotional rhythms
   - Useful for creating anxiety or anticipation
   - Good for representing irregular heartbeats or breathing

6. **Noise**
   - Adds controlled instability to emotional vectors
   - Creates chaotic, unpredictable emotional patterns
   - Perfect for rolling-virus phase
   - Simulates interference or corruption

### Z-Curve Emotional Effects

Different β values in the Z-dimension create distinct emotional mappings:

1. **β = 1.0** (Linear)

   - Direct mapping of trauma to emotional intensity
   - Neutral emotional perspective
   - Balanced across full trauma range

2. **β < 1.0** (Power < 1)

   - Emphasizes lower trauma values
   - Creates higher sensitivity to subtle emotional states
   - De-emphasizes extreme trauma
   - Perfect for cyber-lotus phase

3. **β > 1.0** (Power > 1)
   - Emphasizes higher trauma values
   - De-emphasizes subtle emotional states
   - Creates intense response to extreme trauma
   - Perfect for trauma-core phase

## Usage

```javascript
const { createResonanceSystem } = require('../resonance');

// Create resonance system
const resonanceSystem = createResonanceSystem();

// Generate trauma resonance vector
const resonanceField = resonanceSystem.createResonanceField(
  0.75, // Trauma value (0-1)
  'memory-vessel', // Target component
  {
    phase: 'trauma-core',
    userActivity: 'vulnerability-scan',
  }
);

// Apply resonance to data
const enhancedData = resonanceSystem.applyResonanceToComponent(resonanceField, dataToEnhance);
```

## Phase-Specific Configurations

Each system phase has unique resonance characteristics:

- **cyber-lotus**: Emphasizes lower trauma, tall elliptical paths, reduced strength
- **alien-flora**: Near-linear mapping, wide elliptical paths, balanced strength
- **rolling-virus**: Emphasizes higher trauma, rotated paths, reduced coherence
- **trauma-core**: Strong emphasis on higher trauma, eccentric paths, amplified strength
- **transcendent**: Perfect linear mapping, circular paths, perfect coherence

## Components

Resonance can target specific system components:

- **neural-architecture**: Core system processing
- **memory-vessel**: Memory storage and retrieval
- **security-trauma**: Security and protection systems
- **commerce-integration**: E-commerce and transactional components
- **prompt-engine**: Language and communication systems
- **integration-layer**: Cross-component coordination
- **all**: Global system targeting
