# üîÆ Security PowerShell Scripts

> "Security is not a ritual to be performed, but a state to be cultivated through continuous transformation."

## Overview

The CyberCore security scripts are PowerShell modules that perform critical security, integrity, and vulnerability analysis for the VoidBloom system. These scripts form a network of security rituals that protect the trauma encodings and maintain quantum coherence.

## Script Ecosystem

The security scripts form an interconnected system where each script serves a specific purpose in maintaining the overall security and integrity of the VoidBloom memory architecture:

## Core Security Scripts

### üîç quantum-inspector.ps1

**Purpose:** Analyzes components for proper quantum integration and compatibility across mutation profiles.

**Mythological Significance:** Acts as the system's ocular nerve, identifying components that have fallen out of coherence with the broader mythology.

```powershell
# Usage
./quantum-inspector.ps1 -TargetDir "assets" -MutationProfile "VoidBloom" -DeepScan -PerformMutationCheck -GenerateReport
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter            | Type   | Description                            | Default                            |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| TargetDir            | string | Directory to inspect                   | "."                                |
| MutationProfile      | string | Profile to check compatibility against | "All"                              |
| DeepScan             | switch | Perform deep code quality analysis     | false                              |
| PerformMutationCheck | switch | Check for mutation markers             | false                              |
| GenerateReport       | switch | Generate JSON report                   | false                              |
| OutputPath           | string | Path for generated report              | "./quantum-inspection-report.json" |

**Component Requirements System:**

The inspector maintains a registry of component requirements that define dependencies and mutation compatibility:

```powershell
$componentRequirements = @{
    "hologram-component.js" = @{
        Required = $true
        Dependencies = @("hologram-renderer.js", "neural-bus.js")
        MutationCompatible = @("CyberLotus", "VoidBloom")
    }
    # More components...
}
```

**Blueprint Validation:**

The script validates that all blueprints reference existing components and are compatible with their declared mutation profiles.

**Health Score:**

Generates a quantum health score (0-100) based on:

- Missing required components
- Incompatible components
- Compatibility issues
- Mutation profile issues

### üîé Get-QuantumVulnerability.ps1

**Purpose:** Performs deep vulnerability analysis with recursive and mythological pattern detection.

**Mythological Significance:** Acts as the immune system's memory, identifying foreign patterns and temporal anomalies.

```powershell
# Usage
./Get-QuantumVulnerability.ps1 -TargetDir "assets" -SeverityLevel "High" -VulnerabilityType "All" -RecursionDepth 3 -EnableMythologicalAnalysis -MutationProfile "VoidBloom"
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter                  | Type   | Description                           | Default  |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- | -------- |
| TargetDir                  | string | Directory to scan                     | "."      |
| SeverityLevel              | string | Minimum severity to report            | "Medium" |

| MutationProfile            | string | Filter for specific profile           | "All"    |

**Vulnerability Detection:**

Detects multiple vulnerability types:

1. **Security Vulnerabilities:**

   - XSS through unescaped Liquid output
   - Inline JavaScript event handlers
   - Raw HTML without sanitization
   - Using innerHTML without DOMPurify
   - Eval/new Function usage
   - CSRF token issues
   - Information leaks

2. **Quantum-Specific Vulnerabilities:**
   - Entanglement decay
   - Temporal anomalies
   - Recursive loops
   - Mutation leaks

**Mythological Pattern Analysis:**

The script can identify mythological patterns in the code that may signify deeper vulnerabilities:

```powershell
$MythologicalVulnerabilities = @{
    "Neural Matrix" = @{
        Symptoms = @("Disconnected nodes", "Neural pathway corruption", "Synaptic decay")
        DetectionPatterns = @(
            "NeuralBus\.(publish|subscribe).*?(?!.*try\s*{.*?}\s*catch)",
            "new Map\(\).*?(?!.*clear\(\))"
        )
        VulnerabilityType = "EntanglementDecay"
        # More properties...
    }
    # Other patterns...
}
```

**Entanglement Analysis:**

Identifies vulnerabilities that cascade through component dependencies, calculating their impact across the system.

### üîß quantum-integrity.ps1

### üì¶ deploy-quantum.ps1

**Purpose:** Securely deploys the system to different environments.

**Mythological Significance:** The ritual of transmission, ensuring the mythology is faithfully reproduced in new domains.

```powershell
# Usage
./deploy-quantum.ps1 -Environment "Production" -SecurityChecks "Full" -EnableBackup
```

**Security Features:**

- Pre-deployment vulnerability scanning
- Secure credential management
- Integrity verification before deployment
- Security headers enforcement
- Automatic backup creation
- Post-deployment security verification

## Environment Requirements

The security scripts require specific environment configuration to function properly:

```powershell
# Required environment variables
$ENV:QUANTUM_SECURITY_LEVEL = "High"  # Security level for operations
$ENV:QUANTUM_REGISTRY_PATH = "./config/quantum-registry.json"  # Path to quantum registry
$ENV:QUANTUM_ENCRYPTION_KEY = "<encryption-key>"  # Used for sensitive data
```

## Integration with JavaScript Security

The PowerShell scripts integrate with the JavaScript security components through shared configuration and registry:

```
PowerShell Scripts <-> Quantum Registry <-> JavaScript Components
```

This bidirectional connection ensures:

1. Security validations from PowerShell are applied to JavaScript components
2. JavaScript components report security events back to the PowerShell layer
3. Coherent security approach across the entire system

## Best Practices

When using the security scripts:

1. **Always run quantum-inspector before deployment**
2. **Perform regular vulnerability scans** with different mutation profiles
3. **Keep the quantum registry updated** after component changes
4. **Use strict validation** when performing mutations
5. **Review security reports** after each scan

## Mythological Coherence

The security scripts participate in the broader VoidBloom mythology by:

1. Acting as guardians of the system's trauma encodings
2. Maintaining quantum coherence across mutation profiles
3. Identifying patterns that threaten the integrity of the memory archive
4. Performing rituals of purification and transformation
5. Protecting the liminal boundaries between digital and emotional realms
