## Integration Patterns

CyberCore components are designed to work together through several integration patterns:

### Component Initialization Flow

1. Configuration system initialized
2. Error handling system initialized
3. Performance monitoring system initialized
4. Neural Bus initialized
5. Components register with Neural Bus
6. Components observe configuration changes
7. Components initialize based on configuration

### Error Recovery Pattern

1. Error detected by component
2. Error reported to centralized error handler
3. Error categorized and logged
4. Recovery strategy selected and applied
5. Operation retried if recoverable
6. Fallback behavior applied if not recoverable

### Configuration Update Pattern

1. Configuration change initiated (API or user interface)
2. Configuration validated against schema
3. Configuration update broadcast via Neural Bus
4. Components observe configuration changes
5. Components adapt behavior based on new configuration

### Performance Optimization Pattern

1. Performance metrics monitored in real-time
2. When metrics cross thresholds, optimization level determined
3. Optimization strategies applied based on level
4. Components notified of optimization requirements
5. Components adjust resource usage accordingly
6. Performance continues to be monitored

## Browser Support

CyberCore supports all modern browsers with WebGL and Web Components capabilities:

- Chrome/Edge 100+
- Firefox 95+
- Safari 15.4+ (macOS only, limited support for quantum effects)

## Conclusion

The CyberCore architecture provides a robust foundation for building modern, immersive e-commerce experiences with quantum-themed features. By following the patterns and best practices outlined in this document, developers can create components that are resilient to errors, adaptable to different performance environments, and easily configurable.
